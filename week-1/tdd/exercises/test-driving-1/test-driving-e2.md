# Exercise 2

Apply the imagine how to use it strategy for this brief:

>As a student
So that I can understand my recent motivation
I want an IRB application that stores my motivation ratings
And I want to see the average of my last 3 ratings

Don't implement the solution â€” just imagine how to use it.

You will know it's right by reading the brief back and checking that your imagined solution satisfies it.

```
store_motivation(5)
=> motivation stored
store_motivation(9)
=> motivation stored
store_motivation(10)
=> motivation stored
show_motivation
=> [5, 9, 10] = 8
