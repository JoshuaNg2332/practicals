## Week 1 - Debugging Practicals

This practical was designed to help teach us about how to debug problems using 'p'

Many of the issues were minor character errors but required the liberal use of p on different elements of the code to test the existing outputs to help us better understand the problem.

In exercise 1, we were tasked with a simple hello name problem which was missing, calling the statement within the string and also puts'ing it out to the terminal.
This was narrowed down through using errors to help us find the missing {} but also using p to print out the called statement at the end.

In exercise 2, we had to encode and decode a string of text. Using p, we were able to narrow down the error to the range operator excluding the last letter in the range.
In the decoding error, we found the formatting error with the way it subtracted 65 from the given character index numbers.

In exercise 3, this was about understanding how the factorial exercise worked when you use clear print outs to get a better understanding of the code.

In exercise 4, this was less about solving the same problem from exercise 2 and more about understanding how you can point out the errors to someone so that they could self sufficiently solve the errors themselves.
