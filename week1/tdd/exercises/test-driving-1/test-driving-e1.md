# Exercise 1
Apply the imagine how to use it strategy for this brief:

>As a student
So that I can remember people's names
I want an IRB application that stores the names of people I meet

Don't implement the solution â€” just imagine how to use it.

You will know it's right by reading the brief back and checking that your imagined solution satisfies it.


```
store_names(Josh)
=> names stored
show_names
=> [Josh]
store_names(Charlotte)
=> names stored
show_names
=> [Josh, Charlotte]
```
